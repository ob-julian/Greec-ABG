## Historical Background

The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BC. Derived from the Phoenician alphabet, it was the first script to introduce separate symbols for both vowels and consonants. This innovation greatly influenced later scripts, including the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.

In addition to its use in writing ancient and modern Greek, the Greek alphabet serves as a source of technical symbols in mathematics, science, and various other fields today.

## Why Did I Create This?
